# Horiseon-Refractor

This is a homework assignment where I was given the task to refractor the code for an existing website.

For this assignment, I was tasked with the following:

1. To make the website meet accessibility standards by using semantic elements.
1. To arrange those semantic elements in a logical structure.
1. To make sure all images contained accessible alt attributes.
1. To make sure all heading elements fall in sequential order.
1. To make sure the webpage contained a concise and descriptive title.


I also had to meet the following acceptance criteria:

1. To make sure all links functioned properly.
1. To make sure the application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
1. To make sure the application's CSS file is properly commented.
1. To deploy the website at a live URL.
1. To make sure the application loads with no errors.
1. To submit the Github URL.
1. To create a Github repository that contains the application's code.
1. To make sure the application resembles at least 90% of the mock up image given.
1. To make sure the Github repository has a unique name.
1. To make sure the repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
1. To make sure the repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
1. To have the repository contain multiple descriptive commit messages.
1. To have a quality **README** file with a description, screenshot, and a link to deployed application.

Below is a screen shot of the working application after my task was finished, along with a URL link to the live application.
